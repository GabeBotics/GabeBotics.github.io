        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h2>Latin</h2>
        <div>Erat Ītalia tunc plēna Graecārum artium ac disciplīnārum, studiaque haec 
et in Latiō vehementius tum colēbantur quam nunc eīsdem in oppidīs, et hīc Rōmae propter tranquillitātem reī pūblicae nōn neglegēbantur. Itaque hunc et Tarentīnī etLocrēnsēs et Rēgīnī et Neopolītānī cīvitāte cēterīsque praemiīs dōnārunt, et omnēs, quī aliquid dē ingeniīs poterant iūdicāre, cognitiōne atque hospitiō dignum exīstimārunt. Hāc tantā celebritāte fāmae cum esset iam absentibus nōtus, Rōmam vēnit Mariō cōnsule et
                Catulō.</div>
        
    <h2>English</h2>
    <div>Then, Italy was full of Greek skill and discipline, and these studies were then celebrated even more earnestly in Latium than now in the same towns and in Rome, on the account of the peace of the republic, these were not neglected. And so the Tarentini, Locrenses, Regini, and Neapolitani rewarded him with citizenship and other gifts, and everyone, who were able to judge anything about talent, thought that he was worthy of hospitality and acquaintance. When he was known to absent people because of his widespread reputation. He came to Rome when Marius and Catulus were consul. </div></body></html>
