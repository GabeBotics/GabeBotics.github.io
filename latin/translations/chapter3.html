    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h2>Latin</h2>
    <div>Nactus 
est prīmum cōnsulēs eōs, quōrum alter rēs ad scrībendum maximās, alter cum rēs gestās tum etiam studium atque aurēs adhibēre posset. Statim Lūcullī, cum praetextātus etiam tum Archiās esset, eum domum suam recēpērunt. Dedit etiam hoc nōn sōlum lumen ingenī ac litterārum, vērum etiam nātūrae atque virtūtis, ut domus, quae huius adulēscentiae prīma fāvit, eadem esset familiārissima senectūtī. Erat temporibus illīs iūcundus Metellō illī Numidicō et eius Piō fīliō; audiēbātur ā M. Aemiliō; vīvēbat cum Q. Catulō et patre et fīliō; ā L. Crassō colēbātur. Lūcullōs vērō et Drūsum et Octāviōs et Catōnem et tōtam Hortēnsiōrum domum dēvīnctam cōnsuētūdine cum tenēret, adficiēbātur summō honōre, quod eum nōn sōlum colēbant quī aliquid percipere atque audīre studēbant, vērum etiam sī quī forte simulābant.</div>

    <div>At first he became attached to these consuls, one of whom was able to provide things for the purpose of the greatest writing, the second of whom was able to provide not only exploits but alao eagerness and ears. Immediately the Luculli, even when Archias was then young, they welcomed him into their family. This family gave not only talent and education, but also nature and virtue, that home, which favors the youngness of the man at first, the same family was very friendly with his old age. At this time he was pleasant to that Metellus the Numidican and his son Pius; he was heard by Marcus Aemilio; he was living with Quintus Catulo, both father and son; He was cultivated by Lucius Crassus. Truly he was holding the Lucullus, Drusus, Octavius, Cato, and the entire house of Hortensia bound by intimacy, he was treated with the highest honor, because <span style="-en-paragraph:true;">not only </span>those who were eager to perceive and hear anything but also if anyone by chance was pretending to hear and perceive were cultivating him </div></body></html>
